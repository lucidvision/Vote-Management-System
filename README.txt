Installation Instructions


1.	Place the CD (DVD) into the computer’s disc drive.

2.	You should be prompted with a list of options by Windows. Choose the “Open folder to view files” option.

3.	One of the files you will see will be a zipped file called “Code”. Copy and paste this from the disc to your desired 
        location on your computer. If necessary, create a new directory for this zip file.

4.	Unzip the code folder to the same directory (Optional: dispose of .zip file once everything is unzipped).  Two folders
        should appear as Polling Station and Central Office.

5.	Open Eclipse IDE. You will be prompted to select a workspace. Select the directory that was created/used in the previous 
        step as the workspace.

6.	Select File  =>  Import. In the new window that pops up, select the General header and then select Existing Projects into 
        Workspace and press Next. On the new window that appears, make sure that the Select root directory: checkbox is checked and
        press the Browse button. Search for and select the directory that holds the Polling Station and Central Office directories 
        and press Ok. Select the checkbox of the system you would like to use, Polling Station or Central Office, and select Finish.

7.	On the left side of Eclipse, under Package Explorer, the package you chose will be displayed. Click on the package “Central
	Office” so that it is highlighted. If you want to install/run the Polling Station program, open by double click or clicking 
	on the [+] on PollingStation in the Package explorer, then open the src folder, then open the initialize package, and then 
	double click on Controller.java.

	*Refer to Running Instructions if you would like to run the program without an executable file
	
	(OPTIONAL)

8.	Select File  =>  Export. In the new window that pops up, select the Java header and then select Runnable JAR file option and 
	press Next. On the new window that appears, using the Launch Configuration drop box, select the package “Central Office” or 
	the Controller - Polling Station that you would like to be able to run. Next, select the Browse button beside the Export 
	Destination drop box and find the directory that holds the Polling Station and Central Office directories and choose the 
	respective directory to which package you chose, choose a name for the file (we suggest CentralOffice or PollingStation) and 
	press Save. You will be returned to the previous window, with the two drop boxes filled out, and you will select Finish. 

        Press Ok to any possible warnings.

9.	The file will be created inside the directory that it corresponds to (Central Office or Polling Station).
 
10.	(OPTIONAL) Go into the directory that is spoken of in step 9 *** and right click on the new .jar file and select Create 
        Shortcut. Rename the shortcut to whatever you wish and place it wherever you wish.


Running Instructions
